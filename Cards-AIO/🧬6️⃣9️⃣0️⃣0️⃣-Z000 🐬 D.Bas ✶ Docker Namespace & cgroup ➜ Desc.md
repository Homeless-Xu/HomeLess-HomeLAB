    Docker Container = Namespace + cgroup 


  üî∂ Namespace 

    ‚ÄºÔ∏è Namespace Function:   quarente ‚ÄºÔ∏è
  
    K8s Default Namespace:   Default / Kube-system / Kube-public  
    
    like python version.
    some app need python2. other need python3.
    if you only have one vm.  need both run python2 & python3. 
    you may need namespace.   
    create one namespace install python2 
    create one namespace install python3 
      let different app run at different namespace.
      so both app can run good! 


  üî∂ cgroup 
  
    in linux one task can use all host resource: all cpu/ram/disk 
    but this will make other task slow/die 
    so they create cgroup:  limit the resource task can use.  
    cgroup make docker contain use how much cpu/ram/disk possible. 
    every container have a different cgroup. 
    and you can set how much resource that cgroup/container can use .
