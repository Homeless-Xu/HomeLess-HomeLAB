physical router. need a default route:   0.0.0.0/0 to gateway.
Virtual  Router. need too


ðŸ”µ How 

physical route`s default gateway is firewall`s IP.
Virtual  route`s default gateway is physical`s IP. âžœ @main allow vrf use physical`s ip as gateway.


vrf has his own routing table.
so have to add default gateway inder vrf`s routing table 

/ip route add gateway=172.16.1.1@main routing-table=cust_a
/ip route add gateway=172.16.1.1@main routing-table=cust_b


/ip route add gateway=10.111.111.1@main routing-table=VRF-CRS-CAM
