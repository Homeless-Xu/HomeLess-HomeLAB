```
🔵 mode diff  ✔️ 

    NAT   Mode ➜ do need ip, ip do show in traceroute.  like router  ➜ default mode 
    Trans Mode ➜ no need ip, ip no show in traceroute.  like switch 


🔵 why need trans mode ✅

    router >> firewall >> pc
    if firewall use nat   mode. traffic in router is from firewall.  pc not get ip from router`s dhcp.
    if firewall use trans mode. traffic in router is from pc.        pc can get ip from router`s dhcp.
