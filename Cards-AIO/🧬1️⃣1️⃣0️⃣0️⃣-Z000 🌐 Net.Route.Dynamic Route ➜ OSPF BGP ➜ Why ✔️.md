🔵 Why ✅

you have one physical router and one physical switch.

but you have many vlan.

same vlan need work on both device, so you need config that vlan twice: switch + router.


ospf can help you make manage vlan very easy.



❗️ ospf is sync route between routers, means sync all vlan ❗️
❗️ ospf is sync route between routers, means sync all vlan ❗️

🔵 


if you have small network. you can try static route
if you have large network. manayal config is almost impossible.

so you need something more smart: dynamic route:  like bgp ospf

they can help you sahre route info to other route device.
so you no need config static route anymore.

save you lots time.
