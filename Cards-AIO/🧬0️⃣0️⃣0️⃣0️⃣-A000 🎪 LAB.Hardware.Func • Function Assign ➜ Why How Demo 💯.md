🔵 Why ✔️

    small network like home:    one hardware do all job: firewall + router + switch + AP.
    big   network like company: one hardware do one job: 
        so company need a lot hardware. 
        


🔵 Device Function Desc ✔️ 

    
    use right device do right thing.
        use graphical card for game, instead of use cpu buildin gpu.
    
    
    	- firewall have hardware-firewall chip for firewall.
    	- router   have high-performace   CPU  for route 
    	- switch   have hardware-switch   chip for switch 
    
    
    Almost No Device can good at firewall/route/switch at same time. 
        use switch to bonding/LDAP maybe use very hign cpu!!!!  and speed is slow too ❗️
    


🔶 Internet  ✅

    ❗️ hardware_router   `s firewall default allow all (so between vlan is allowed by default) ❗️
    ❗️ hardware_Firewall `s firewall default Deny  all ❗️
    
    so internet cable on firewall is better choose.  much safety.
    if you have hardware firewall. it can be route too... so next can be switch.
    
    internet >> firewall >> route (option) >> switch 
    


🔶 VLAN ✅ 

    all device can create & manage vlan.   (switch / router /firewall)
    
        vlan no   routing                     ➜ Switch 
        vlan need routing_simple  function    ➜ L3 Switch 
        vlan need routing_advance function    ➜ Router / Firewall
        
    
    vlan need ospf >> switch >> route .....
