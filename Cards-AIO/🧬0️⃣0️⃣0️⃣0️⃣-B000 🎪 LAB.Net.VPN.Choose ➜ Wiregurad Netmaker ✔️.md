🔵 Final result

    1= vps: choose wireguard
    2+ vps: choose netmaker

        wireguard is not  smart. but only need one vps host. 
        netmaker  is much smart. but must need two vps host.

            🔥 netmaker server itself can not be vpn node. so need another vps.
            🔥 netmaker server itself can not be vpn node. so need another vps.
            🔥 netmaker server itself can not be vpn node. so need another vps.







🔵 Why Wireguard & netmaker  

    Wireguard best. fastest.
    netmaker make deploy wireguard much easy.

    server:  lots docker 
    client:  one docker/one cmd



🔵 Netmaker Srv ( Host vs Docker )   ✅

    ‼️ use Docker is easy. but host itself can not join vpn network

    ‼️ use Docker is easy. but host itself can not join vpn network 
        https://docs.netmaker.org/troubleshoot.html?highlight=host


    use docker compose build netmaker server node is very easy.
        but by default. server host itself in not joined to vpn network.
        and you can not install netclient to server host node 
            - you can not install both netmaker & netclient at same host.
                - host`s docker can     visit vpn network.
                - host itself   can not visit vpn network. 
            
    so if you have two vps.  
        vps_srv install netmaker. 
        vps_cli install netclient. ➜ use this vps to visit your homelab vlan.


    if you only have one vps. 
        you need use reverse proxy tool. like traefik/nginx/nginx proxy manager.
            to help your vps visit vlan inside homelab. 
                netmaker have build in traefik already.  we can use this too.

        edit traefik docker.  
            add static router to traefik forward homelab vlan to netmaker
                make traefik docker can visit vpn & homelab lan.
                    then set rever proxy on traefik.

🔵 Demo & Needs

    we need iphone visit all vlan under homelab. via internet. 

    (ingress Gateway)   internet:     VPN.Srv.VPS      10.214.214.254
    (egress  Gateway)   homelab:      VPN.CLI.LAB      10.214.214.1    ➜  a lot vlan
    (client         )   iPhone:       VPN.CLI.iphone   10.214.214.x  



🔵 Build VPN Network 

    🔶 win / mac /linux 

        add srv.vps.    ➜  config netmaker setting.
        add cli.lab     ➜  connect homelab & vps   
            now cli.lab can ping srv.vps use 10.214.214.0/24
            but srv.vps not able ping vlan under cli.lab.


     🔶 Iphone/andriod

        phone is not supprted yet. 
        so need one more step. use one node as relay.

        config srv.vps as ingress gataway.
        add cli.iphone under ingress gateway.  ➜ so iphone can ping 10.214.214.0/24 



🔵 Config Egress 

    egress gateway allow you visit vlan under homelab.
    config cli.lab as egress gateway.
        allow 10.214.214.0/24  to visit vlan under homelab.
            egress gateway range:  172.16.1.0/24    ➜ one vlan under homelab.
            interface name: ens160                  ➜ which nic netmaker forward 172.16.1.0 traffic to 
                login to cli.lab server. get your nic name.

        egress will add  postup & postdown / firewall rules to cli.lab node. like. 
            iptables -A FORWARD -i nm-demo -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
            iptables -D FORWARD -i nm-demo -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

        egress will add 172.16.1.0/24   to all  vpn nodes. too 
        so all vpn node can ping 172.16.1.0/24 


    🔶 srv node test.

        we use netmaker docker in vps. 
        so need enter docker to test. -.- 
        it works. 


    🔶 cli.iphone test 
    
        ‼️ if change some netmaker config. iphone need delete old vpn config. rescan the qr code ‼️
