        AS  is for Network Device: Router 

🔶 ASN Desc ✔️

    ASN
        LAN have private/public use range. 192.168.xxx.xxx  
        AS  have private/public use range.
    
    ASN have 2^16=65535 totally available.
    1023 is private use:  64512-65534
    no need lots of asn
    so 654XX is enough


🔶 How Design AS

    Inside  AS use ibgp to connect two router
    Between AS use ebgp to connect two router
    
    one datecenter one as.
    one datecenter one firewall
    
    firewall: 
    fgt: def ➜ 65411
    fgt. eg3  ➜ 65433
    fgt. eg5 ➜ 65455



🔶 ASN Demo

    65422 >> RB4.DEF
    65433 >> RB4.EG3
    65455 >> RB4.EG5
