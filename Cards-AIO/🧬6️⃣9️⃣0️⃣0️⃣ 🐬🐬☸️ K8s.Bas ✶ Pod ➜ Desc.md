ðŸ”µ Pod Desc 

    POD = Connect Multi namespace & cgroup.
    means Connect Milti Container Together 

    Containeres under same POD. can connect each other ! 
    Containeres under same POD. like under same host/machine ! 

    if app need more than one Containeres to work.
    so best way is make those Containeres use same POD. 
    give every app a different pod.


    ðŸ”¶ pod simple 

      k8s manager app(pod)
          one app = one or more container 
            all container under same pod use same network & storage
