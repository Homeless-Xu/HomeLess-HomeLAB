    docker config  need prepair before start container.
    k8s  configmap need prepair before start pod


    all config you need mount in docker;   you can add to configmap.

    configmap is a folder. 
        you can let one  pod use one  configmap file.
        you can let many pod use same configmap file. 


    pod will search all configmap file. 
    if found something for himself. pod will auto use it. (no need restart!)


    usually 
        if a pod need very much   config.    create a configmap file for it. 
        if a pod need very little config .   use same configmap file with other pod.
