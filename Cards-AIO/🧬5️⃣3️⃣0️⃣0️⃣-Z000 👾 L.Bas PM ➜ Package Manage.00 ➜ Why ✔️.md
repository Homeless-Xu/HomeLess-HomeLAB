🧬🔶 Linux Package Manager Why ✔️

    - online  install ➜ one cmd                    ➜ like MacOS    app store
    - offline install ➜ manual download + install  ➜ like windows  exe

    online install is easyiest way and recommond way.
    you can find most app in offical(default) app store

    there are many other app stores too ! 
        offical store ➜ default 
        xxx     store ➜ need config
        yyy     store ➜ need config

    OS usually has different store.
    by default you are only allowed install app included in offical app store.

    if you need install app not in offical app store.
    you need add that store`s url to package manager first.
