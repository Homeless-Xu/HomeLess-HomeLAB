    ❗️loopback work all the time.  routerid not work some times, so best set both ❗️
    ❗️loopback work all the time.  routerid not work some times, so best set both ❗️


both have very same function: give router a unique ID. like driver ID.
    loopback is better than routerid & have more setting.
        but some device not have loopback like routeros, 
            better create one for it 
                and use both routerid & loopback
