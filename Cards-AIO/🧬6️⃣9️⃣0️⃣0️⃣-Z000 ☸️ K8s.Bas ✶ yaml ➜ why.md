ðŸ”µ why yaml 

    you can create pod use kubectl âžœ  like create docker use cmd
    best choose is use yaml  file  âžœ  like docker-compose.yaml 

    in linux everything is file 
    in k8s   everything is yaml

        even driver need use yaml too like ceph-csi storage driver. 

          create a xx.yaml for pod, 
            kubectl create -f xx.yaml
              to run that pod
