ðŸ”µ why 

    100v/50A.  12v system.
    max panel is 12v * 50A = 600w 
    
    best    600w one mppt control. 
    option  900w one mppt control âžœ because most time panel only produce 70% of max. 
    

ðŸ”µ can you âžœ yes 

    more watt than mppt is ok. but more voltage is not ok
    100/50 mppt control.  if you hook1400w panel on it. this is ok. 
    mppt only accept 50A.  other are wasted.
