vlink allow  connect  two different vdom.

firewall only have one wan port.  
but we have many vdom. 

wan port is for root vdom by default.
so root vdom can have internet.

but other no wan port. so no internet. 
so we need use vlink .to connect other vdom to root vdom.
and let internet traffic go from root vdom.
