ðŸ”µ NAT Why 
in internet all device need ip to talk.
but ipv4 is limited, so they create private and public ip.

private ip is for lan. no access to www
public  ip is for www. no access to lan.
so lan and www is totally diffenent.

between www and lan âžœ you need nat 
between lan and lan âžœ no  need nat (use route forward)






ðŸ”µ NAT Desc 


nat  = change     ip
snat = change src ip  âžœ usually for lan to wan
dnat = change dst ip  âžœ usually for wan to lan

```
