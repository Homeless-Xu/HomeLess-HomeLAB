    after you deploy your app to k8s, next is visit our app! 

    k8s give every pod a virtual ip. 
    so pods inside k8s can visit each other.

    but you can`t. you are not pods, you are not a part of k8s cluster.
    if your web broswer need visit app. 
    you need setup service first.
    service can help you visit pods inside k8s cluster.
    
    Service put all pods together.
    you visit service. you visit all pods under service.
    it is a bridge between you (out cluster) to pods(in cluster)
