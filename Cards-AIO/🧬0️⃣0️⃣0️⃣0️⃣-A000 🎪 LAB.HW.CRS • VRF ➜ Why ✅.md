ðŸ”µ Why 

    port on router. should/better connect to switch.
    we only have one physical switch. 
    we only need one cable. 
    
    but you can use vrf function.
    vrf can divide one physical device. to some small device.
    means one big physical switch. to some small virtual switch.
    just like vm in host. 
    
    
    one small switch  use one cable to router.
    so you can use all your router`s port ^.^
