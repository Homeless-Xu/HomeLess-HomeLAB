🔵 L3 Switch & Router ➜ Diff ✅💯

Router use IP  to deal package, IP  is in Layer3 ➜ So Normal L3 Device = Router (L3 Router)
Switch use Mac to deal package, Mac is in Layer2 ➜ So Normal L2 Device = Switch (L2 Switch)

L3 Switch is a different Device. 
L3 Switch = L2 Switch(Full Function) + L3 Router(Part Function)


❗️ L3 Switch use Mac to deal layer3 package, instead of use ip like L3 Router ❗️
❗️ L3 Switch use Mac to deal layer3 package, instead of use ip like L3 Router ❗️
❗️ L3 Switch use Mac to deal layer3 package, instead of use ip like L3 Router ❗️


because L3 Switch use Mac instead of IP.

	- L3 Switch use Hardware-CHIP  for route (L3 Router use Software/CPU)
		L3 Switch is much much faster. 
		L3 Switch have much more nic 


	- L3 Switch is Route Function is limited!!! 
		L3 Switch no support nat function ( means no wan, wan need set nat in firewall )
		L3 Switch no support QOS 



🔵 How Choose 

    internet      ➜  L3 Switch not support.  must use router / firewall 
    
    vlan to vlan  ➜  L3 Switch first if you have one -.-   much faster!    


❗️ CRS328 support L3 switch. but very very weak. so .. use it as L2 Switch. ❗️
