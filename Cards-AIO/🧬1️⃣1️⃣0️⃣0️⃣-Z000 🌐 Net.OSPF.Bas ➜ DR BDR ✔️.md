DR:           Designated Router 
BDR:  backup  Designated Router 




ðŸ”¶ WHY 

all ospf router have a role:   
    ospf.sync.server âžœ DR_main   BDR_backup
    ospf.sync.client âžœ all other except DR/BDR


you need choose a router as sync.server Main   âžœ DR 
you need choose a router as sync.server Backup âžœ BDR 


all ospf.sync.client sync route from DR/BDR
