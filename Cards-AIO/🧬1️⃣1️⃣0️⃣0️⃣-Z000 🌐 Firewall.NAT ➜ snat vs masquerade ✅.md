```

snat ➜ change package source ip. ➜ need know change ip to what.
    if you have fixed public ip.  so set it to that ip
    if you ni   fxied public ip.  need use masquerade

masquerade can auto get you public ip in real time.
but this use cpu. slow down your speed.
so if have fixed public ip . choose snat first.  of course use masquerade works too.
