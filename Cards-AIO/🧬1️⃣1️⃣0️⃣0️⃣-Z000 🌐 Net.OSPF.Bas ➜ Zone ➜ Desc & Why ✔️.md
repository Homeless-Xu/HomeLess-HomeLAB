ðŸ”¶ zone/area desc 

    like vlan. 
    vlan is for manage device.
    zone is for manege router.

    ospf can    run under one large zone.
    ospf better use           small zone.


ðŸ”¶ why zone/area 
    
    if no zone. one route changes network.  all other route changes too.
    
    and differnet router have different goal.
    you need category those router.



just like vlan.
    one large lan too many device. too many broadcast.  slow whole network.
    use vlan help improve speed. and make manager easy too.
