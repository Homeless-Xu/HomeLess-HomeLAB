ðŸ”µ MPLS Why 

           Switch    Route
----------------------------
switch:    good      no  
router:    weak      good      
MPLS:      good      good



switch use mac            handle data âžœ use switch-chip  âžœ fast but stupid
router use ip             handle data âžœ use cpu          âžœ slow but smart
MPLS   use mac+label=ip   handle data âžœ use switch-chip  âžœ fast and smart



MPLS is old tech.
at old time cpu is too weak. have to use mpls to improve speed.
at now time cpu is not weak. no need use mpls unless you need it.


if you use mpls to link differnet vlan.
the speed will very fast.
