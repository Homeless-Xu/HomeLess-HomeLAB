```
lots vlan under firewall ➜ deny  by default ➜ vlan can`t visit other vlan
lots vlan under router   ➜ allow by default ➜ vlan can   visit other vlan

we usually assign vlan in switch.    sometimes in router.

we can use firewall rule to control vlan.
but we can use vrf too.

vrf make one device to many device! 

you buy one firewall. you can have many virtual firwall
you buy one router.   you can have many virtual router
you buy one switch.   you can have many virtual switch
