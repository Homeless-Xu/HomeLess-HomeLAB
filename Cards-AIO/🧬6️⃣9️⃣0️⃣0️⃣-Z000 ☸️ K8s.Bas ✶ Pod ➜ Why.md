ðŸ”µ why pod 

    k8s is for manager app/pod
    but some app need many container work together.
    and those container under one app must need in same host/node.
    if k8s need move one container in that app. k8s must move all container of that app.

    one pod is like one vm: virtual machine.
    all container under one vm can connect each other.
